# cat-vs-dog-popularity

This is a visualisation project which I have done in Power BI

This interactive visualisation explores the dog and cats population with respect to household in various states of U.S. Here I used Power Query Editor to transform and load data then utilised Power BI's visualisation to present Data in the form of a Dashboard.
